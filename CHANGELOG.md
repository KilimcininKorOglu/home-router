# Changelog

All notable changes to LANKeeper are documented in this file.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [0.1.0] - 2026-05-06

Initial public release. LANKeeper is a single-binary Go + HTMX home
router/gateway/NAS targeting Debian 12, with two-process privilege
separation (unprivileged web UI + root agent over JSON-RPC on a
Unix domain socket).

### Added

- **Networking core**: PPPoE WAN, dual-stack IPv4/IPv6, VLAN support,
  static and dynamic routing, USB tethering fallback, multi-NIC
  bridging via first-boot wizard.
- **Firewall**: nftables with atomic apply and 30 s watchdog
  rollback, rendered from a versioned template, with bootstrap
  ruleset loaded before `sshd` starts.
- **DNS**: Unbound recursive resolver with optional DNS-over-TLS
  upstream, inline DoT connectivity probe, split-DNS overrides,
  static A/AAAA/PTR records, per-record reverse PTR opt-out.
- **DHCP**: dnsmasq DHCP server with static leases that auto-mirror
  to persistent DNS records (`Source: dhcp-static`); domain change
  rebuilds all mirrored records.
- **VPN**: WireGuard server + clients with QR provisioning, OpenVPN
  server + clients via easy-rsa PKI.
- **NAS**: Samba shares with M3U playlist parser, SMART monitoring,
  RAID-1 via mdadm, storage device management.
- **QoS**: CAKE qdisc with IFB ingress shaping, per-interface
  bandwidth control.
- **NTP**: chrony server with bind address, port, and allow-subnet
  management.
- **Syslog**: rsyslog server (UDP/TCP/TLS RFC 5425) and forwarding
  client with facility routing and TLS UI.
- **Backup**: encrypted configuration export/import (AES-256-GCM),
  tar archive ingest with path-traversal protection.
- **OTA updates**: GitHub Releases consumer with `runtime.GOARCH`
  asset selection, SHA-256 verification, atomic binary swap, 60 s
  watchdog rollback, GRUB version branding, persistent state
  surviving restarts.
- **Web UI**: HTMX + SSE, dark mode, full Turkish/English i18n
  (every visible string), session auth (bcrypt + gorilla/sessions),
  CSRF double-submit cookie, LAN-only IP whitelist, per-IP rate
  limiter, automatic ECDSA P-256 TLS certificate generation, mkcert
  and ACME support, Content-Security-Policy header.
- **Deployment**: offline preseed installer ISO (amd64 + arm64),
  Docker-based ISO builder with cached `.deb` repository, install
  script, systemd target orchestrating root agent + unprivileged
  web service, install-time config rendering for unbound, dnsmasq,
  chrony, rsyslog, smbd.

### Security

- Two-process privilege separation: web service runs as `lankeeper`
  user, all system commands route through a root agent over a
  localhost Unix domain socket (mode 0666).
- Strict agent command whitelist (44 binaries) and typed file path
  rules (dir prefix, exact file, filename prefix) with symlink
  resolution.
- Bootstrap nftables ruleset shipped before SSH start to prevent
  WAN exposure during the boot transient.
- Firewall, DNS, NTP, syslog input validators reject newline
  injection in rendered config files.
- ACME and self-signed TLS certificates generated server-side; no
  default password and no random fallback (admin sets the password
  during install).

### Known Limitations

- Single admin user; no role-based access control.
- IPv6 prefix delegation handled by `wide-dhcpv6-client` only; no
  DHCPv6-PD UI yet.
- 6in4/IPv6 tunneling not implemented.
